### There are *lots* of really great Shiny resources out there

The following slides were adapted largely from existing materials, particularly: 

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Garrett Grolemund's [Building Web Applications with Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) tutorial (find the [GitHub Repo here](ttps://github.com/rstudio-education/shiny.rstudio.com-tutorial))</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Allison Horst's [The Basics of Building Shiny Apps in R](https://github.com/allisonhorst/shiny-basics-sb-r-ladies) workshop</span>

<br>

But there are endless other resources and tutorials to explore. Some suggested started points:

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-app.html), by Hadley Wickham</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` [Building Shiny apps - an interactive tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/), by Dean Attali</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` A thoughtfully organized [Articles](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/) page, by Shiny and the folks at RStudio</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` The [Shiny User Showcase](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#user-showcase), a collection of Shiny apps and their source code developed by the Shiny developer community -- many of these featured apps are winners or honorable mentions of the [annual Shiny contest](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/winners-of-the-3rd-annual-shiny-contest/)!</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` [Shiny Demos](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#demos), a series of apps created by the Shiny developers to highlight specific features of the shiny package -- these are *excellent* resources to turn to when you are learning how to implement a new type of widget, working on the layout of your app, and more.</span>

## What is Shiny?

---
### Shiny makes building web applications easy

> *"**Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.** You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626) documents or build [dashboards](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626). You can also extend your Shiny apps with [CSS themes](http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/?_ga=2.94499804.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626), [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and JavaScript [actions.](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/blob/master/README.md)"* - RStudio

## Can I see an example please?

---
### The Shiny package comes with **11** built-in examples to explore

Install (if you have not yet done so) and import the `{shiny}` package by running the following code in your console:
```{r install shiny, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
```

Check out the available Shiny app examples:
```{r shiny built-in example 1, eval = FALSE}
runExample(example = NA)
```

Run the first example, which plots Râ€™s built-in `faithful` data set with a configurable number of bins:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
runExample("01_hello")
```
