## `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` What is Shiny?

Think interactive web pages built by people who love to code in R (i.e. hopefully many of you!), no JavaScript experience necessary.

---
### Shiny makes building web applications easy

> *"**Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.** You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626) documents or build [dashboards](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626). You can also extend your Shiny apps with [CSS themes](http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/?_ga=2.94499804.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626), [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and JavaScript [actions.](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/blob/master/README.md)"* - RStudio

The next two widgets are slider inputs -- the first allows the user to select a year between 1960 and 2014, and the second allows the user to select a population size between 500 and 5000. On the right hand side of the app is a bubble plot of Fertility Rate vs. Life Expectancy, which updates as inputs are changed by the user.

## `r fontawesome::fa("puzzle-piece", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` The anatomy of a Shiny app

What does a shiny app look like under the hood?

---
## The basic anatomy of a Shiny app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Shiny apps are composed to *two parts*: (1) a **web page** that displays the app to a user (i.e. the **user interface**, or **UI** for short), and (2) a **computer** that powers the app (i.e. the **server**).</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/basic_shiny_app.png")
```
]

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>The **UI** controls the **layout and appearance** of your app and is written in HTML (except we use functions from the `{shiny}` package to write that HTML!). The **server** handles the **logic** of the app -- in other words, it is the set of instructions that tells the web page what to display when a user interacts with it.</span>
---
### Widgets are web elements that users can interact with via the UI

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Widgets collect information from the user which is then used to update outputs created in the server.</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Examples of Shiny's pre-built widget options. These include buttons, single checkbox, checkbox groups, date input, date range, file input, numeric input, radio buttons, select box, sliders, and text input. The default color scheme is black and gray with selections highlighted in blue."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/basic_widgets.png")
```
]

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Shiny comes with a variety of [pre-built widgets](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/) (see above), but you can also explore widget extensions using the [{shinyWidgets}](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets) package.</span>
---
### Reactivity - a very brief intro

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Reactivity is what makes Shiny apps responsive i.e. it lets the app instantly update itself whenever the user makes a change. At a very basic level, it looks something like this:</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '90%', out.height = '90%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A schematic of Shiny reactivity. (1) A widget gets information from a user which (2) is then passed to the server where it is used to update a data frame based on the users choice. (3) The new data frame is used to update outputs in the server, and (4) those outputs are then rendered in the UI."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/reactivity_intro.png")
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Check out Garrett Grolemund's article, [How to understand reactivity in R](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/understanding-reactivity.html) for a more detailed overview of Shiny reactivity.</span>

## `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Can I see an example with code please?

I'm glad you asked!

---
### The Shiny package comes with **11** built-in examples to explore

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Install (if you have not yet done so) the `{shiny}` package by running the following code in your console:</span>
```{r install shiny, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shiny")
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Check out the available Shiny app examples by running this code in your console:</span>
```{r shiny built-in example 1, eval = TRUE}
library(shiny)
runExample(example = NA)
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Run the first example, which plots Râs built-in `faithful` data set with a configurable number of bins:</span>

## `r fontawesome::fa("play", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Creating your first Shiny app

Before we get started, make sure to set up a GitHub repository and R project to house our soon-to-be Shiny app. Doesn't matter what you call it--I'll call mine something like, "practice-shiny".

*NOTE:* When setting up your GitHub repo, be sure to initialize with both a README file and a .gitignore file using the R template.

---
### The data

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>We'll be using two different data sets to create our Shiny app: **(1)** the `penguins` data set from the [`{palmerpenguins}`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package and **(2)** the [Palmer Station Weather - Daily Averages](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-pal.28.8) dataset from the Palmer Station Antarctic LTER.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>To access the **penguin** data set, you need to install and load the `{palmerpenguins}` package into R. Type `View(penguins)` into your console to open the data frame in the viewer. Type `?penguins` into your console to pull up additional information (including metadata) in the Help window of RStudio.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Download the Palmer weather time series data (`table_28.csv`) and view its metadata on the [EDI Data Portal](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/cddd3985350334b876cd7d6d1a5bc7bf). Alternatively, you can download the file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1du5KHtDt_zzgBKAFxNYtdEAzfp7bfuGm/view?usp=sharing).</span>

```{r, out.width = '25%', out.height = '25%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Three penguins standing in a row. The first is a chinstrap penguin, facing to the right so that we see its body and face profile. It has a black head, back, top of wings wings, and bill, but a white face, chin, belly, underside of wings, and light pink feet. A thin black line runs under its chin, looking similar to a chinstrap. It is standing in front of a purple background. The second is a Gentoo peguin facing towards us with its wings spread out to the side. It has a black face, back, and top of its wings, but a white belly, underside of wings, and wide white stripes above each eye that extend over the top of its head, like a bonnet. It has a bright orange bill and feet. It is standing in front of a green background. The third is an AdÃ©lie penguin with its body facing towards us but its head turned to the left so that we see its face profile. It has a completely black head, bill, back, and top of its wings. It has a white belly, underside of its wings, and thin white circles around its eyes, in addition to light pink feet. It is standing in front of an orange background."}

### All Shiny apps begin the same way

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>You can create your app using RStudio's built-in Shiny app template (e.g. File > New Project... > New Directory > Shiny Application), but it's just as easy to create it from scratch (and you'll memorize the structure faster!). Let's do that now.</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Create a new R script and name it `app.R` -- you **must** name your script `app.R`, otherwise it will not be recognized as a Shiny app. Copy the following code into your `app.R` script, or use the `shinyapp` snippet to automatically generate a shiny app template.</span>

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# load packages ----
library(shiny)

# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage()

# server instructions ----
server <- function(input, output) {}

# run the application ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>It's best practice to place this `app.R` file into its own folder and *not* in a folder that contains other scripts/files, *unless* those other files are used by your app. This is a good segue into talking about repository files structure...</span>

.footnote[
<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**Tip:** Use code sections (denoted by `# some text ----`) to make navigating different sections of your application code a bit easier. Code sections will appear in your document outline (find the button at the top right corner of the script/editor panel or use the `shift` + `command/control` + `O` keyboard shortcut).</span>
]

## Shiny app repository structure

COME BACK TO THIS PAGE 

```
my-app
|_myapp # make sure the name of this directory is at least 4 characters long
  |_app.R
  |_processed_data
    |_my_data.csv
  |_functions.R
  |_www
    |_my_img.png
|_raw_data
  |_raw_data.csv
  
```
---
## Run your app

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>Once you have saved your `app.R` file, the "Run" code button should turn into a "Run App" button that looks like:</span> <img src="media/run_app.png" alt="A green, right facing triangular arrow next to the words 'Run App'" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:80px;height:20px;"/> <span style = 'font-size:75%;'>Click that button to run your app!</span>

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>You won't see much yet, as we have only built a blank app (but a functioning app, nonetheless!). In your RStudio console, you should see something like: `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:XXXX`, which is the URL where your app can be found. 127.0.0.1 is a standard address that means "this computer," and the last four digits represent a randomly assigned port number.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>You should also notice a red stop sign, <img src="media/stop.png" alt="A red hexagon with the word 'STOP' printed in white across the center." style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/>, appear in the top right corner of your console indicating that R is busy--this is because your R session is currently acting as your Shiny app server and listening for any user interaction with your app. Because of this, you won't be able to run any commands in the console until you quit your app. Do so by pressing the stop button.</span>

```{r, out.width = '85%', out.height = '85%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/blank_app.png")
```

## An alternative: two-file Shiny apps

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>While we'll be building both our UI and our server within the same `app.R` file, you may choose to split these into two separate files called `ui.R` and `server.R`. Separating the UI and server can make it easier to navigate and manage code for larger, more complex applications. Note that when splitting your UI and server into separate files, you do not need to include the `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)` line of code. </span>

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

# app.R
ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "num",
              label = "Choose a number", 
              value = 25, min = 1, max = 100),
  plotOutput("hist")
)


server <- function(input, output) {
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$num))
  })
}


shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

# ui.R
ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "num",
              label = "Choose a number", 
              value = 25, min = 1, max = 100),
  plotOutput("hist")
)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

# server.R
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$num))
  })
}
```
]

.footnote[
<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**PRACTICE:** Create a blank, two-file shiny app **in a new directory** (i.e. folder) and run the app. You can do so by clicking the "Run App" button from either the `ui.R` or `server.R` file, or run the command, `runApp("<your_directory_name>")` in the console (this also works for running your single `app.R` file).</span>

## `r fontawesome::fa("tools", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Building out your Shiny app

Here, we'll add our first reactive object to our app and establish a general Shiny coding workflow.

---
### Let's first add some text to our app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We'll do this in the **UI** within `fluidPage()`, a layout function that sets up the basic visual structure of the page and scales components in real time to fill all available browser width. Add a title and subtitle to your app (*be sure to separate each with a comma, `,`*), save, and run:</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  "My App Title",
  
  # app subtitle ----
  "Exploring Antarctic Penguins and Temperatures"
  
  )
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Recall that the UI is actually just an HTML document. We can add static HTML elements using [**tags**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html), a list of functions that parallel common HTML tages (e.g. `tags$h1()`) The most common tags also have wrapper functions (e.g. `h1()`). We can use some of these tags to spruce up our text:</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  tags$h1("My App Title"),
  
  # app subtitle ----
  p(strong("Exploring Antarctic Penguins and Temperatures"))
  
  )
```

### Adding inputs and outputs

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Next, we will begin to add some inputs and outputs to our `fluidPage()` (anything that you put into `fluidPage()` will end up in our app...and we want inputs and outputs in our app!).</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**Inputs** are the things that users can interact with (e.g. toggle, slide) and provide values to your app. The Input functions below correspond to the widgets you see on slide #8. **Outputs** are the R objects that your user sees (e.g. tables, plots) and are what respond when a user interacts with/changes an input value.</span>

### Input function syntax

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` All input functions have the same first argument, `inputId` (**NOTE:** `Id` *not* `ID`), which is used to connect the front end of your app (the UI) with the back end (the server). For example, if your UI has an `inputId = "name"`, the server function will access is using the syntax `input$name`. The `inputId` has two constraints: **(1)** it must be a simple string containing only letters, numbers, and underscores, **(2)** it must be unique.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Most input functions have a second parameter called `label`, which is used to create a human-readable label for the control, which will appear in the UI.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` The remaining arguments are unique to each input function. Oftentimes, these include  a `value` parameter, which lets you set the default value of your widget, where applicable.</span>

Some examples: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):", value = c(3000, 4000), ...)

selectInput(inputId = "island", label = "Choose and island:", ...)
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Check out the interactive [Shiny Widgets Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) to learn how to implement the most common widgets.</span>

---
### Add an input to our app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>First let's add a `sliderInput()` that will allow users to select a range of penguin body sizes (g).</span>
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # * previous code omitted for brevity *
  
  # body mass slider input ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              value = c(3000, 4000), min = 2700, max = 6300)
  )
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>When you run your app, you should see something similar to the image below. It's operable, but does not yet have an associated output.</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '70%', out.height = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A basic Shiny app, with a title that says 'My App Title', a subtitle that says, 'Exploring Palmer Penguins and Antarctic Temperatures, and a slider input with a label that says 'Select a range of body masses (g)'. The slider bar has a minimum value of 2,700 and a maximum value of 6,300, and the moveable slider selectors currently range from 3,000 to 4,000."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/sliderInput.png")
```
]

---
### Output function syntax

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Outputs in the UI create **placeholders** which are later filled by the server function.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Similar to input functions, all output functions take the same first argument, `outputId` (again, note `Id` *not* `ID`), which connects the front end UI with the back end server. For example, if your UI has an `outputId = "plot"`, the server function will access it using the syntax `output$plot`.</span>

Some examples: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_plot")

dataTableOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_dt")
```

---
### Add an output to our app

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Let's now add a `plotOutput()` to our app, which will be updated based on the user inputs via the `sliderInput()`.</span>
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # * previous code omitted for brevity *
  
  # body mass slider input ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              value = c(3000, 4000), min = 2700, max = 6300)
  
  # body mass plot ouput ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_scatterPlot")
  
  )
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Okay, it looks like nothing changed?? Remember, `*Output()` functions create *placeholders*, but we have not yet written the server instructions on how to fill and update those placeholders. We can inspect the HTML and see that there is, in fact, a placeholder area awaiting our eventual output, which will be a plot named "bodyMass_scatterPlot":</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '60%', out.height = '60%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A Google Chrome browser window with our Shiny app open on the left-hand side and the underlying HTML document open on the right. The app looks the same as before, except hovering over the HTML associated with our new plotOutput highlights a blue square region beneath the sliderInput. This highlighted region is the placeholder where our plot will eventually be rendered."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/output_placeholder.png")
```
]

---
### Rendering outputs

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Each `*Output()` function in the UI is coupled with a `render*()` function in the server, which contains the "instructions" for creating the output based on user inputs. A list of `*Output()` functions and their corresponding `render*()` functions are below:</span>

<br>

.center[
| Output function        | Render function        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `dataTableOutput()`    | `renderDataTable()`    |
| `imageOutput()`        | `renderImage()`        |
| `plotOutput()`         | `renderPlot()`         |
| `verbatimTextOutput()` | `renderPrint()`        |
| `tableOutput()`        | `renderTable()`        |
| `textOutput()`         | `renderText()`         |
| `uiOutput()`           | `renderUI()`           |
| `plotlyOutput()`       | `renderPlotly()`       |
| `DTOutput()`           | `renderDT()`           |
]

### Tell the server how to assemble inputs into outputs

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Now that we've designed our input/output in the UI, we need to write the server instructions (i.e. write the server function) on how to actually assemble our input (body weight range via a slider input) into the output (scatter plot).</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>The **server function** is defined with two arguments, `input` and `output`, both of which are list-like objects. You *must* define both of these arguments within the server function. `input` contains the values of all the different inputs at any given time, while `output` is where you'll save output objects to display in the app.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>This part can be intimidating, but if you follow these three rules, you will successfully create reactivity within your shiny app!</span>

**Rules:**

### <span style = 'font-size:90%;'>**Rule 1:** Save objects you want to display to `output$<id>`</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Notice that in our **UI**, we created a placeholder for our plot using the `plotOutput()` function and gave it the Id `"bodyMass_scatterplot"`. In our **server**, we will save our plot to the `output` argument by its `outputId`:</span>

### A non-reactive plot now lives in our `plotOutput()` placeholder

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We have a plot (yay!), but it isn't reactive. We have not yet told the server how to update the plot based on user inputs to the `sliderInput()` in the UI. Let's do that next...</span>

### Let's first practice in our separate script

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>First, create a new df where we filter `body_mass_g` observations for values within a specific range:</span>

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
body_mass_filtered <- penguins %>%
  filter(body_mass_g %in% 3000:4000) 
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Then, substitute in the new filtered data and plot:</span>

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
body_mass_dat <- penguins %>%
  filter(body_mass_g %in% 3000:4000) # 3000:4000 needs to be update-able! 
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**For example:**</span>

### <span style = 'font-size:90%;'>**Rule 3:** Access input values with `input$<id>`</span>

<span style = 'font-size:60%;'>In our UI, we gave our `sliderInput()` an `inputId = "body_mass"`. In our server, we can access the values of that slider input using the syntax, `input$body_mass`.

### Okay, RUN THAT APP!

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>You should now have a reactive Shiny app! *Note that reactivity automatically occurs whenever you use an **input value** to **render** an **output object**.*</span>

```{r, out.width = '60%', out.height = '60%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of our current Shiny app, demonstrating reactivity. At the top left of our app is the title, 'My App Title' in large header font. Beneath it is a subtitle, 'Exploring Antarctic Penguins and Temperatures'. Below the subtitle is the slider input with the label, 'Select a range of body masses (g)'. A gray horizontal slider bar ranges from the values 2,700 to 6,300. The interactive slider value selectors are two round white circles, which, when moved apart from one another highlight the selected value range in blue. The user is adjusting the slider value selectors and the scatterplot of penguin bill length (mm) vs. flipper length (mm) is automatically updating."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/reactive_app_v1.gif")
```
]

---
### Recap so far:

We created our first *reactive* Shiny app by following these steps:

--

1. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We created an `app.R` file and began our app with the template</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We saved `app.R` to its own directory where we will also save any other scripts/files used by the app</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>You can also create two-file Shiny apps by creating separate `ui.R` and `server.R` files</span>
--
2. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We added an `input()` to the `fluidPage()` in our **UI** and gave it an `inputId`</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`inputId`s are surrounded by quotes, `""` (e.g. `inputId = "input_name"`)</span>
--
3. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We created a placeholder for our reactive object using an `*Output()` function in the `fluidPage()` in our **UI** and gave it an `outputId`</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`outputId`'s are also surrounded by quotes, `""` (e.g. `outputId = "output_name"`)</span>
--
4. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We wrote the **server** instructions for how to assemble inputs into outputs, following these rules:</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>save objects that you want to display to `output$<id>`</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>build objects you want to display using a `render*()` function</span>  
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>access input values with `input$<id>`</span>  

--

And we saw that reactivity automatically occurs whenever we use an **input value** to **render** an **output object**.

## `r fontawesome::fa("upload", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Publishing your first Shiny app

Sharing your Shiny app with others isn't so easy when it just lives on your computer (and your R session has to act as the server that powers it). We'll now learn how to host your app using [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), a free service for sharing your Shiny apps online.

---
### Connect your shinyapps.io account to RStudio

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Go to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and login or create an account (if you don't already have one).</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>To use shinyapps.io, you first need to link your account with RStudio on your computer. Follow the instructions on shinyapps.io when you first create your account to install `{rsconnect}` and authorize your account:</span>
