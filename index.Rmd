## `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` What is Shiny?

Think interactive web pages built by people who love to code in R (i.e. hopefully many of you!), no JavaScript experience necessary.

### Shiny makes building web applications easy

> *"**Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.** You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626) documents or build [dashboards](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626). You can also extend your Shiny apps with [CSS themes](http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/?_ga=2.94499804.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626), [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and JavaScript [actions.](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/blob/master/README.md)"* - RStudio

The next two widgets are slider inputs -- the first allows the user to select a year between 1960 and 2014, and the second allows the user to select a population size between 500 and 5000. On the right hand side of the app is a bubble plot of Fertility Rate vs. Life Expectancy, which updates as inputs are changed by the user.

## `r fontawesome::fa("puzzle-piece", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` The anatomy of a Shiny app

What does a shiny app look like under the hood?

---
## The basic anatomy of a Shiny app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Shiny apps are composed to *two parts*: (1) a **web page** that displays the app to a user (i.e. the **user interface**, or **UI** for short), and (2) a **computer** that powers the app (i.e. the **server**).</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/basic_shiny_app.png")
```
]

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>The **UI** controls the **layout and appearance** of your app and is written in HTML (except we use functions from the `{shiny}` package to write that HTML!). The **server** handles the **logic** of the app -- in other words, it is the set of instructions that tells the web page what to display when a user interacts with it.</span>
---
### Widgets are web elements that users can interact with via the UI

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Widgets collect information from the user which is then used to update outputs created in the server.</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Examples of Shiny's pre-built widget options. These include buttons, single checkbox, checkbox groups, date input, date range, file input, numeric input, radio buttons, select box, sliders, and text input. The default color scheme is black and gray with selections highlighted in blue."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/basic_widgets.png")
```
]

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Shiny comes with a variety of [pre-built widgets](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/) (see above), but you can also explore widget extensions using the [{shinyWidgets}](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets) package.</span>
---
### Reactivity - a very brief intro

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Reactivity is what makes Shiny apps responsive i.e. it lets the app instantly update itself whenever the user makes a change. At a very basic level, it looks something like this:</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '90%', out.height = '90%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A schematic of Shiny reactivity. The UI is represented by a light blue box. Inside the blue UI box, there is a radio button widget that says, 'Make a choice:' and three round radio buttons beneath it. Underneath that, there is a placeholder space for a reactive output to be created by the server. The server is to the left of the UI and is represented by an orange box. At a basic level, reactivity occurs after the following steps: (1) A widget gets information from a user which (2) is then passed to the server where it is used to update a data frame based on the users choice. (3) The new data frame is used to update outputs in the server, and (4) those outputs are then rendered in the UI."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/reactivity_intro.png")
```

## `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Can I see an example with code please?

I'm glad you asked!

---
### <span style = 'font-size:90%;'>The Shiny package comes with **11** built-in examples to explore</span>

<span style = 'font-size:65%;'>Install (if you have not yet done so) the `{shiny}` package by running the following code in your console:</span>
```{r install shiny, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shiny")
```

<span style = 'font-size:65%;'>Check out the available Shiny app examples by running this code in your console:</span>
```{r shiny built-in example 1, eval = TRUE}
library(shiny)
runExample(example = NA)
```

<span style = 'font-size:65%;'>Run the first example, which plots R’s built-in `faithful` data set with a configurable number of bins:</span>
```{r, eval = FALSE}
runExample("01_hello")
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:65%;'>Change the number of bins using the `sliderInput` widget and watch the histogram re-render. These working examples also come paired with code for you to see how the app is built. For example, the `sliderInput` is built with the following code:</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
            label = "Number of bins:",
             min = 1,
             max = 50,
             value = 30)
```

### Let's build our own! What to expect:

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We're going to cover a lot today, but by the end, you should have the tools you need to get you started making your own *awesome* shiny apps. We will:</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**1.** build & publish (to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)) a basic shiny app with a reactive element using `{palmerpenguins}` data</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**2.** spruce up the appearance of our app using layout functions, then republish to shinyapps.io</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**3.** practice adding more reactive elements using `{palmerpenguins}` data</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**4.** learn how to read in and store data (from the Palmer Station Antarctic LTER) and, you guessed it, practice creating more reactive elements</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**5.** add some fun touches, like a theme and images</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**6.** learn how to use `{reactlog}` to debug shiny apps</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**7.** flex your creative shiny muscles to design and add a reactive element using the Palmer weather data set

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**8.** briefly talk about other application frameworks and additional considerations</span> 

---
### The data

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>We'll be using two different data sets to create our Shiny app: **(1)** the `penguins` data set from the [`{palmerpenguins}`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package and **(2)** the [Palmer Station Weather - Daily Averages](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-pal.28.8) dataset from the Palmer Station Antarctic LTER.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>To access the **penguin** data set, you need to install and load the `{palmerpenguins}` package into R. Type `View(penguins)` into your console to open the data frame in the viewer. Type `?penguins` into your console to pull up additional information (including metadata) in the Help window of RStudio.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Download the Palmer weather time series data (`table_28.csv`) and view its metadata on the [EDI Data Portal](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/cddd3985350334b876cd7d6d1a5bc7bf). Alternatively, you can download the file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1du5KHtDt_zzgBKAFxNYtdEAzfp7bfuGm/view?usp=sharing).</span>

```{r, out.width = '25%', out.height = '25%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Three penguins standing in a row. The first is a chinstrap penguin, facing to the right so that we see its body and face profile. It has a black head, back, top of wings wings, and bill, but a white face, chin, belly, underside of wings, and light pink feet. A thin black line runs under its chin, looking similar to a chinstrap. It is standing in front of a purple background. The second is a Gentoo peguin facing towards us with its wings spread out to the side. It has a black face, back, and top of its wings, but a white belly, underside of wings, and wide white stripes above each eye that extend over the top of its head, like a bonnet. It has a bright orange bill and feet. It is standing in front of a green background. The third is an Adélie penguin with its body facing towards us but its head turned to the left so that we see its face profile. It has a completely black head, bill, back, and top of its wings. It has a white belly, underside of its wings, and thin white circles around its eyes, in addition to light pink feet. It is standing in front of an orange background."}

## `r fontawesome::fa("play", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Setting up your Shiny app

Let's start off by talking about some standard operating procedures -- things you'll do each time you begin a new shiny app. 

To start, set up a GitHub repository and project to house or soon-to-be app.

---
### All Shiny apps begin the same way

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>You can create your app using RStudio's built-in Shiny app template (e.g. File > New Project... > New Directory > Shiny Application), but it's just as easy to create it from scratch (and you'll memorize the structure faster!). Let's do that now.</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Create a new R script and name it `app.R` -- you **must** name your script `app.R`, otherwise it will not be recognized as a Shiny app. Copy the following code into your `app.R` script, or use the `shinyapp` snippet to automatically generate a shiny app template.</span>

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# load packages ----
library(shiny)

# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage()

# server instructions ----
server <- function(input, output) {}

# combine UI & server into an app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>It's best practice to place this `app.R` file into its own folder and *not* in a folder that contains other scripts/files, *unless* those other files are used by your app. This is a good segue into talking about repository files structure...</span>

.footnote[
<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**Tip:** Use code sections (denoted by `# some text ----`) to make navigating different sections of your application code a bit easier. Code sections will appear in your document outline (find the button at the top right corner of the script/editor panel or use the `shift` + `command/control` + `O` keyboard shortcut).</span>
]

---
## Shiny app repository structure

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Not much is *required* to make a functional app (which is awesome!) -- for a basic app, you really just need an `app.R` file where you'll write the code for your UI and server. To stay organized we'll place `app.R` into a subdirectory (e.g. `myapp`), which will also house any dependencies (e.g. other scripts/files/etc.) used by `app.R`.</span>

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/repo_structure.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
* <span style = 'font-size:55%;'>**app directory (e.g. the `myapp` folder):** stores your app (`app.R`) and all other scripts/files/etc. used by your app</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:55%;'>**`global.R`:** a script for storing commonly used pieces of logic and objects you want available to both your `ui.R` and `server.R`; can reduce redundant code and increase the app's speed; must be in the same directory as `app.R`</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:55%;'>**data directory (e.g. the `data` folder):** stores the data used by your app; alternatively, you can [store your data remotely](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/persistent-data-storage.html) (e.g. Google Sheets, Dropbox)</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:55%;'>**`www` directory:** a directory expected by Shiny that stores any elements to be rendered in the web browser (and are not the output of the scripts); includes image files (e.g. `.png`, `.jpeg`), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, etc.</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:55%;'>**`R` directory (outside of app folder):** a place for any scripts not used by your app; I find that building my outputs first in a separate script helps me from going cross-eyed -- I store them here </span>
]

---
## Run your app

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>Once you have saved your `app.R` file, the "Run" code button should turn into a "Run App" button that looks like:</span> <img src="media/run_app.png" alt="A green, right facing triangular arrow next to the words 'Run App'" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:80px;height:20px;"/> <span style = 'font-size:75%;'>Click that button to run your app!</span>

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>You won't see much yet, as we have only built a blank app (but a functioning app, nonetheless!). In your RStudio console, you should see something like: `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:XXXX`, which is the URL where your app can be found. 127.0.0.1 is a standard address that means "this computer," and the last four digits represent a randomly assigned port number.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>You should also notice a red stop sign, <img src="media/stop.png" alt="A red hexagon with the word 'STOP' printed in white across the center." style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/>, appear in the top right corner of your console indicating that R is busy--this is because your R session is currently acting as your Shiny app server and listening for any user interaction with your app. Because of this, you won't be able to run any commands in the console until you quit your app. Do so by pressing the stop button.</span>

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = '85%', out.height = '85%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}

## An alternative: two-file Shiny apps

<span style = 'font-size:75%;'>While we'll be building both our UI and our server within the same `app.R` file, you may choose to split these into two separate files called `ui.R` and `server.R`. Separating the UI and server can make it easier to navigate and manage code for larger, more complex applications. Note that when splitting your UI and server into separate files, you do not need to include the `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)` line of code. </span>

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

  sliderInput(inputId = "num",

## `r fontawesome::fa("tools", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Building out your Shiny app

Here, we'll add our first reactive object to our app and establish a general Shiny coding workflow.

### Let's first add some text to our app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We'll do this in the **UI** within `fluidPage()`, a layout function that sets up the basic visual structure of the page and scales components in real time to fill all available browser width. Add a title and subtitle to your app (*be sure to separate each with a comma, `,`*), save, and run:</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  "My App Title",
  
  # app subtitle ----
  "Exploring Antarctic Penguins and Temperatures"
  
  )
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Recall that the UI is actually just an HTML document. We can add static HTML elements using [tags](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html), a list of functions that parallel common HTML tages (e.g. `tags$h1()`) The most common tags also have wrapper functions (e.g. `h1()`). We can use some of these tags to spruce up our text:</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  tags$h1("My App Title"), # alternatively, you can use the h1() wrapper function
  
  # app subtitle ----
  p(strong("Exploring Antarctic Penguins and Temperatures")) 
  
  )
```

### Adding inputs and outputs

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Next, we will begin to add some inputs and outputs to our `fluidPage()` (anything that you put into `fluidPage()` will end up in our app...and we want inputs and outputs in our app!).</span>

### Input function syntax

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` **All input functions have the same first argument, `inputId`** (**NOTE:** `Id` *not* `ID`), **which is used to connect the front end of your app (the UI) with the back end (the server).** For example, if your UI has an `inputId = "name"`, the server function will access is using the syntax `input$name`. The `inputId` has two constraints: **(1)** it must be a simple string containing only letters, numbers, and underscores, **(2)** it must be unique.</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Most input functions have a second parameter called `label`, which is used to create a human-readable label for the control, which will appear in the UI.</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` The remaining arguments are unique to each input function. Oftentimes, these include  a `value` parameter, which lets you set the default value of your widget, where applicable.</span>

--

Some examples: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):", value = c(3000, 4000), ...)

selectInput(inputId = "island", label = "Choose and island:", ...)
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Check out the interactive [Shiny Widgets Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) to learn how to implement the most common widgets.</span>

---
### **Step 1:** Add an input to our app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>First let's add a `sliderInput()` that will allow users to select a range of penguin body masses (g).</span>
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # ~ previous code omitted for brevity ~
  
  # body mass slider input ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              value = c(3000, 4000), min = 2700, max = 6300)
  )
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>When you run your app, you should see something similar to the image below. It's operable, but does not yet have an associated output.</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '70%', out.height = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A basic Shiny app, with a title that says 'My App Title', a subtitle that says, 'Exploring Palmer Penguins and Antarctic Temperatures, and a slider input with a label that says 'Select a range of body masses (g)'. The slider bar has a minimum value of 2,700 and a maximum value of 6,300, and the moveable slider selectors currently range from 3,000 to 4,000."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/sliderInput.png")
```
]

---
### Output function syntax

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Outputs in the UI create **placeholders** which are later filled by the server function.</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Similar to input functions, **all output functions take the same first argument, `outputId`** (again, note `Id` *not* `ID`), **which connects the front end UI with the back end server.** For example, if your UI has an `outputId = "plot"`, the server function will access it using the syntax `output$plot`.</span>

Some examples: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_plot")

dataTableOutput(outputId = "penguin_data")
```

---
### **Step 2:** Add an output to our app

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Let's now add a `plotOutput()` to our app, which will be updated based on the user inputs via the `sliderInput()`.</span>
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # ~ previous code omitted for brevity ~
  
  # body mass slider input ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              value = c(3000, 4000), min = 2700, max = 6300)
  
  # body mass plot ouput ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_scatterPlot")
  
  )
```

--

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Okay, it looks like nothing changed?? Remember, `*Output()` functions create *placeholders*, but we have not yet written the server instructions on how to fill and update those placeholders. We can inspect the HTML and see that there is, in fact, a placeholder area awaiting our eventual output, which will be a plot named "bodyMass_scatterPlot":</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '60%', out.height = '60%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A Google Chrome browser window with our Shiny app open on the left-hand side and the underlying HTML document open on the right. The app looks the same as before, except hovering over the HTML associated with our new plotOutput highlights a blue square region beneath the sliderInput. This highlighted region is the placeholder where our plot will eventually be rendered."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/output_placeholder.png")
```
]

---
### Rendering outputs

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Each `*Output()` function in the UI is coupled with a `render*()` function in the server, which contains the "instructions" for creating the output based on user inputs (or in other words, the instructions for making your output *reactive*). A list of `*Output()` functions and their corresponding `render*()` functions are below:</span>

<br>

.center[
| Output function        | Render function        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `dataTableOutput()`    | `renderDataTable()`    |
| `imageOutput()`        | `renderImage()`        |
| `plotOutput()`         | `renderPlot()`         |
| `verbatimTextOutput()` | `renderPrint()`        |
| `tableOutput()`        | `renderTable()`        |
| `textOutput()`         | `renderText()`         |
| `uiOutput()`           | `renderUI()`           |
| `plotlyOutput()`       | `renderPlotly()`       |
| `DTOutput()`           | `renderDT()`           |
]

---
### <span style = 'font-size:90%;'>**Step 3:** Tell the server how to assemble inputs into outputs</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Now that we've designed our input/output in the UI, we need to write the server instructions (i.e. write the server function) on how to actually assemble our input (body mass range via a slider input) into the output (scatter plot).</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>The **server function** is defined with two arguments, `input` and `output`, both of which are list-like objects. You *must* define both of these arguments within the server function. `input` contains the values of all the different inputs at any given time, while `output` is where you'll save output objects to display in the app.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>This part can be intimidating, but if you follow these three rules, you will successfully create reactivity within your shiny app!</span>

**Rules:**

**1.** Save objects you want to display to `output$<id>` 

<br>
--
**2.** Build reactive objects using a `render*()` function  

<br>
--
**3.** Access input values with `input$<id>`  

---
### <span style = 'font-size:90%;'>**Rule 1:** Save objects you want to display to `output$<id>`</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Notice that in our **UI**, we created a placeholder for our plot using the `plotOutput()` function and gave it the Id `"bodyMass_scatterplot"`. In our **server**, we will save our plot to the `output` argument by its `outputId`:</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # ~ previous code omitted for brevity ~
  
  # body mass slider ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              value = c(3000, 4000), min = 2700, max = 6300),
  
  # body mass plot output ----
  plotOutput(`outputId = "bodyMass_scatterPlot"`) 
  
)

# server instructions ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # render the scatter plot ----
  `output$bodyMass_scatterPlot <-` # code to generate plot here
  
}
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**Note:** In the **UI**, our `outputId` is quoted (`"bodyMass_scatterPlot"`), but not in the **server** (`bodyMass_scatterPlot`).</span>
 
---
### <span style = 'font-size:90%;'>**Rule 2:** Build reactive objects with `render*()`</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Use the appropriate `render*()` function to make your output reactive (e.g. if you have a `plotOutput` in your UI, you will need to use `renderPlot()` in your server).</span> 

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Within your `render*()`,  write any code *inside* a set of curly braces, `{}`. This allows you to include as many lines of code as it takes to build your object.</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # ~ previous code omitted for brevity ~
  
  # body mass slider ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              value = c(3000, 4000), min = 2700, max = 6300),
  
  # body mass plot output ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_scatterPlot") 
  
)

# server instructions ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # render the scatter plot ----
  `output$bodyMass_scatterPlot <- renderPlot({`

<span style = 'font-size:60%;'>**Importantly**, just as we have used `render*()` to produce a reactive output, we need to use `reactive()` to create reactive data frames that update with user inputs.

Below the subtitle is the slider input with the label, 'Select a range of body masses (g)'. A gray horizontal slider bar ranges from the values 2,700 to 6,300. The interactive slider value selectors are two round white circles, which, when moved apart from one another highlight the selected value range in blue.

### Recap so far:

We created our first *reactive* Shiny app by following these steps:

--

1. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We created an `app.R` file and began our app with the template</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We saved `app.R` to its own directory where we will also save any other scripts/files used by the app</span>
      * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>You can also create two-file Shiny apps by creating separate `ui.R` and `server.R` files</span>
--
2. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We added an `input()` to the `fluidPage()` in our **UI** and gave it an `inputId`</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`inputId`s are surrounded by quotes, `""` (e.g. `inputId = "input_name"`)</span>
--
3. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We created a placeholder for our reactive object using an `*Output()` function in the `fluidPage()` in our **UI** and gave it an `outputId`</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`outputId`'s are also surrounded by quotes, `""` (e.g. `outputId = "output_name"`)</span>
--
4. <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We wrote the **server** instructions for how to assemble inputs into outputs, following these rules:</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>save objects that you want to display to `output$<id>`</span>
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>build reactive objects using a `render*()` function</span>  
      * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>similarly, build reactive data frames using `reactive()`</span>  
    * <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>access input values with `input$<id>`</span>  

--

And we saw that reactivity automatically occurs whenever we use an **input value** to **render** an **output object**.

### **Exercise 1:** Add another widget to your app!

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>`{DT}` is a package that provides an R interface to the JavaScript library [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) (you may have already used the `DT` package in your knitted RMarkdown HTML documents!). DataTables provides filtering, pagination, sorting, and lots of other neat features for tables on your HTML pages.</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '90%', out.height = '90%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of an interactive DT data table, displaying the penguins data set from the palmerpenguins R package. Five rows of data (out of the 344 rows) are displayed as the default. The cursor first moves to bottom of the table to click on page 2 then page 3 to display rows 6-10 then 11-15. The cursor is then moved to the 'Previous' button, which is directly to the left the page numbers and clicks twice to move back to the first page, displaying rows 1-5 again. The cursor then moves to a small drop down selector at the top left corner of the table which allows the user to select the number of entries (i.e. rows) to display. The user changes the selection from the default 5 rows to 10 rows. The cursor is then used to click into the 'Search' box at the top right of the table. The user types in 'Gentoo' to filter for any instances of 'Gentoo' throughout the displayed data table. The user deletes the word 'Gentoo' from the search box and the data returns to displaying all unfiltered data. The cursor is moved to the column labeled 'bill_depth_mm' and clicks on a small upward facing carrot to the right of the column name. This arranges the values from smallest to largest. It then clicks on the downward facing carrot to arrange the values from largest to smallest. Finally, the cursor is used to click on the upward facing carrot next to the 'species' column name to arrange species names in alphabetical order. Clicking the downward facing carrot arranges obserations in reverse alphabetical order, though the gif cuts out before the results are fully displayed."}

* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Add an *italicized* caption above the top left corner of your table</span>

<span style = 'font-size:90%;'>**Some tips to get you started:**</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Remember, it can help to draft your R object (in this case, a `DT::datatable`) in a separate script</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Both `shiny` and `DT` packages have functions named `dataTableOutput()` and `renderDataTable()`. `DT::renderDataTable()` allows you to create both server-side and client-side DataTables and supports additional DataTables features while `shiny::renderDataTable()` only provides server-side DataTables. Be sure to specify that you want to use functions from the `DT` package.</span>

Sharing your Shiny app with others isn't so easy when it just lives on your computer (and your R session has to act as the server that powers it). We'll now learn how to host your app using [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), a free service for sharing your Shiny apps online.

---
### Connect your shinyapps.io account to RStudio

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Go to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and login or create an account (if you don't already have one).</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>To use shinyapps.io, you first need to link your account with RStudio on your computer. Follow the instructions on shinyapps.io when you first create your account to install `{rsconnect}` and authorize your account:</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/shinyapps_setup.png")

### Deploy your app to shinyapps.io

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Once your account has been authorized, run `rsconnect::deployApp("<app_directory_name>")` in your console to deploy your app to shinyapps.io. Alternatively, you can click on the "Publish",<img src="media/publish.png" alt="The word 'Publish' in black text with a small, black down facing arrow to its right. To the left of 'Publish' is a small blue circle icon with a split blue outer circle." style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:65px;height:20px;"/>, button in the top right corner of your app.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Once deployed, a browser will open to your application. The URL will take the form: https://username.shinyapps.io/your_app_directory_name</span>

### The shinyapps.io dashboard

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Your shinyapps.io dashboard provides tons of information about your application(s) metrics, instance (the virtualized server that your app is hosted on) and worker (a special type of R process that an Application Instance runs to service requests to an application) settings, plan management, and more. The free plan (the plan we're using here today) allows you to deploy **five** Shiny apps.</span>

## `r fontawesome::fa("columns", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Layouts

Up until now, we have been adding our text and widgets to our UI in a pretty unstructured way -- elements stack one on top of the other within a single column. Next, we'll learn how to customize the layout of our application to make it a bit more visually pleasing. 

---
### <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Layout functions provide the high-level visual structure of your app</span>

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Layouts are created using a hierarchy of function calls **inside** `fluidPage()`. You'll find some minimal examples of these layout functions on the following slides.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**Some useful layout function pairings:**</span>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# sidebar for inputs & main area for outputs within the sidebarLayout() container
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel(),
  mainPanel()
)

# multi-row fluid layout (add any number of fluidRow()s to a fluidPage())
fluidRow(
  column(4, ...),
  column(8, ...)
)

# tabPanel()s to contain HTML components (e.g. inputs/outputs) within the tabsetPanel() container
tabsetPanel(
  tabPanel()
)

# page with top-level navigation bar that can be used to toggle tabPanel() elements
navbarPage(
  tabPanel()
)
```

.footnote[
<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>**Note:** Under the hood, `fluidPage()` sets up all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript that Shiny needs. It's a super important function! Therefore, all layout functions are called inside `fluidPage()`. Check out the documentation for `fixedPage()` and `fillPage()` which may be substituted for `fluidPage()` in more specialized situations.</span>

### Layouts: create a sidebar and main area

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>To create a **page with a side bar and main area** to contain your inputs and outputs (respectively), explore the following layout functions and read up on the [sidebarLayout documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.6.0/sidebarLayout.html):</span>

### **Exercise 2:** Outline your app's layout

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Take some time to experiment and outline your application's appearance using the layout functions we've just reviewed. If you need some inspiration, take a look at the minimal reproducible examples on the following slides.</span>

**To Do:**
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Outline your Shiny app creating space to fill with the following text/R objects:
    * application intro/background info
    * reactive `palmerpenguins` scatterplot (*we've already created this one together*)
    * reactive `palmerpenguins` histogram
    * `palmerpenguins` `DT` table (*we've created this one already too*)
    * reactive Palmer weather plot
    * reactive Palmer weather `DT` table

**Some tips to get you started:**
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Sketch out your layout with a pen and paper first! It's worth noting that you'll likely choose to start with this step (followed by coding up your UI layout) before building any inputs/outputs/etc. as you start to build your own apps.</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Add some text to note where your intended inputs/outputs should live (e.g. `tabPanel("scatterplot input & output here")`.)</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Temporarily comment out the inputs/outputs/text in your UI while you build out your layout functions. We'll un-comment them and move them to the appropriate tabs, etc. once we have a layout we like.</span>

### **Exercise 3:** Add scatterplot and `DT` table inputs/outputs back into your app's UI

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Now that you have the bones of your application's UI layout coded up, it's time to add back in your inputs and outputs.</span>

**Some tips to get you started:**
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Copy inputs and outputs from our original app (the one built just using `fluidPage()` to contain all of our elements) and paste them into the new application's layout function framework</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Be mindful of `()` when copying/pasting -- make sure you don't leave any behind by accident (**Tip:** enable Rainbow Parentheses (under 'Code' in the menu bar) if you haven't already)</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Remember to separate UI elements with a `,`</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>If you want to reproduce the app I'm building, start with the layout structure detailed on [slide #58](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#89) (*Example B: a navigation bar with `tabPanel()`s and nested `tabsetPanel()`s*) </span>

### My app, so far:

**UI:**
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  navbarPage(
    "Exploring Antarctic Penguins & Weather",
    tabPanel("Background",
             em("some background information here")),
    tabPanel("Antarctic Penguins",
             tabsetPanel(
               `tabPanel("Scatterplot",` 
                        # body mass slider input ---- 
                        `sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",`

                        # body mass plot output ---- 
                        `plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_scatterPlot")),` 
               tabPanel("Histogram",
                        em("histogram input & output here")))),
    tabPanel("Antarctic Weather",
             em("some widget to explore weather data here")),
    tabPanel("Explore the Data",
             tabsetPanel(
               `tabPanel("Penguin Data",`

```

<span style = 'font-size:65%;'>**Note:** I've collapsed my parentheses all into the same rows so that the code fit on one slide...but I'd recommend pressing `return`/`enter` each time you open up a new set of parentheses to better keep track of what belongs where.

### My app, so far:

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>The code from the previous two slides produces:</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "An empty shiny app with a navbar layout. The navbar is colored light gray and spans the width of the screen at the top of the webpage.

### Republish our app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Now that we've refined our application's layout a bit more, let's republish to [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io/). To do so:</span>  

--

  

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**1.** Rerun `rsconnect::deployApp("<app_directory_name>")` in your console and select `Y` when you see the prompt, `Update application currently deployed at https:://githubUserName.shinapps.io/yourAppName? [Y/n]`</span>    

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**2.** Give it a minute (or a few) to deploy. It should open up a browser window with your republished app once processed.</span>  

--

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**3.** Push your files to GitHub.</span>  

---
### **Exercise 4:** Add a reactive histogram

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Time to flex your reactivity skills! Add a second reactive plot to your Shiny app.</span>

.pull-left[
**To Do:**
* <span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Create a reactive histogram of penguin flipper lengths (similar to the one shown here) with a `shinyWidgets::pickerInput` that allows users to filter displayed data by island(s)</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Be sure to include a `label`, default to all islands selected, and include buttons that allow users to "Select All" or "Deselect All" islands at once</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Add the `pickerInput` and rendered histogram output to your shiny app where appropriate</span>
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/hist.png")
```
]

**Some tips to get your started:**
* <span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Check out the [`pickerInput` documentation](https://dreamrs.github.io/shinyWidgets/reference/pickerInput.html) to learn more about the arguments you'll need to include</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Once you've created your reactive histogram output, pay close attention to the species colors when you select different islands. Notice anything strange? How might you address this issue (if you haven't already done so)?

              selected = c("Torgersen", "Dream", "Biscoe"),
              multiple = T),
  
  # flipper length plot output ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "flipperLength_hist")
  
)

# NOTE: actions-box should be surrounded by backticks, which were replaced here with apostrophes as to not trigger highlighting :)  
```

        filter(island == input$island)
    })

  # render the flipper length histogram ----
  output$flipperLength_hist <- renderPlot({

    ggplot(na.omit(island_df()), aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
      geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "#FEA346", "Chinstrap" = "#B251F1", "Gentoo" = "#4BA4A4")) +
      labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Frequency",

### <span style = 'font-size:85%;'>What happens if you **Deselect All** islands using the `pickerInput`?</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>You get a pretty alarming, bright red error message in your app's UI:</span>

##`r fontawesome::fa("file", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Reading in data

More likely than not, you'll be loading data into your app rather than using built-in data sets. Here we'll do just that, and of course, practice building more reactive widgets (no such thing as too much practice, right?).

If you have not yet already done so, be sure to download the *daily averaged weather time series data from Palmer Station, Antarctica* ([table_28.csv](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-pal.28.8)).

---
### Saving and accessing your data

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Where you choose to store the data used by your Shiny app will depend largely on the type and size of the file(s) and who "owns" those data. It is likely that you'll be working with data stored in a database or on a server. This is outside the scope of this workshop, but I suggest reading Dean Attali's article, [Persistent data storage in Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/persistent-data-storage.html) to start. Because we are going to be working with a relatively small data set, we'll be downloading and storing our data locally (i.e. on our machines and in our GitHub repo).</span>

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>Regardless of where you choose to store your data, you can help your application more quickly process inputs/outputs by providing it only as much data as needed to run. This means **pre-processing** your data.</span>

--

.center[
```{r, out.width = '50%', out.height = '50%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/repo_structure_data.png")
```
]

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>[`table_28.csv`](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-pal.28.8) contains 24 attributes and 10,674 observations (you can review the full metadata record [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-pal.28.8)), though we'll only need a subset of those data for our app. We will save the original (raw) data file *outside* of our app directory and pre-process it in a separate script (i.e. *not* in `app.R`).</span>

---
### Where we're going...

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>We're going to create a **`DT` datatable that displays the mean, maximum, and minimum air temperatures by year and month**. We'll make this table *reactive* by adding a `checkboxGroupInput` that allows a user to **select which month(s)** to display summary stats for.</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '70%', out.height = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/temp_DT_demo.gif")
```
]

---
### Pre-processing your data

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>I'll wrangle my data in a separate script, which I've stored in my `R` directory (if you're referencing the GitHub repo for my example app, this is the [`summarize_temp_data.R` script](https://github.com/samanthacsik/practice-shiny/blob/main/R/summarize_temp_data.R)).</span>

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# import packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# load in data 
weather_data <- read_csv(here::here("raw_data", "table_28.csv"))

# temps by month and year 
temp_month_summary <- weather_data %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = format(date, format="%Y")) %>% 
  mutate(month = format(date, format="%m")) %>% 
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_temp = round(mean(temperature_average_c), 1),
    max_temp  = max(temperature_high_c),
    min_temp  = min(temperature_low_c),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(month_numeric = as.numeric(month),
         month_name = month.name[month_numeric]) %>% 
  select(year, month_name, mean_temp, max_temp, min_temp)
```

---
### Saving your processed data

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>If you are working with tabular data (as we are in this example), you may choose to save your processed data frame as a `.rds` file (R's own data file format which stores a single R object). Not only are `.rds` file are relatively small (and therefore take up little storage space), but they also preserve data types and classes (e.g. factors and dates), eliminating the need to redefine data types after loading the file.</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>I'm going to save my wrangled data as a `.rds` file using the function `saveRDS()`:</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# be sure to update this code with YOUR file path
saveRDS(temp_month_summary, here::here(".", "myapp", "data", "temp_month_summary.rds"))
```

.footnote[
**Reminder:** You can check out my GitHub repo repository structure [here](https://github.com/samanthacsik/practice-shiny).
]

---
### Reading your data into your app

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>It's best practice to read your data into your `app.R` file at the top of the script (I've done so just below where I load my packages). Here, I'm using the function `readRDS()`.</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# load packages ----
library(shiny)

# import data ----
temp_summary <- readRDS("data/temp_month_summary.rds") #<<

# ui ----
ui <- fluidPage()

# server ----
server <- function(input, output) {}

# combine UI & server into an app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

.footnote[
**Note:** If you are building a two-file shiny app, make sure to import your data into `server.R`.

### **Exercise 6:** Add a reactive `DT` table using the Palmer weather data

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>In **Exercise 1**, you added a `DT` table to your app, which was *interactive* but not *reactive*. Now, we'll practice adding a `DT` table with a `checkboxGroupInput` that allows users to select a subset of the data to display.</span>

**To Do:**
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Add a `DT` table to your Shiny app in the appropriate location (i.e. replace any placeholder text) that displays our processed data: year, month, mean air temperature, maximum air temperature, and minimum air temperature. You may make any formatting updates (e.g. number of displayed rows, change default styling options) as you see fit.</span>
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Add a `checkboxGroupInput` that allows users to select the **month(s)** that they wish to display data for.</span>

**Some tips to get you started:**
* <span style = 'font-size:80%;'>As in our previous exercises, try this out in a separate script first before moving back into the Shiny framework to make it reactive!</span>

### Using `{bslib}` for themeing Shiny apps

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>There are lots of approaches (and packages) for customizing the appearance of your Shiny app (Hadley Wickham lists out a handful in [Ch 6.4](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-layout.html#bootstrap) of Mastering Shiny). Here, we'll use the [`{bslib}` package](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/), which provides tools for customizing [Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/theming/) from R.</span> 

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>By default, Shiny uses the Bootstrap v3 theme (which is not so exciting...). Change the theme to a slightly more exciting Bootstrap v4 theme by setting the `theme` argument of `fluidPage()` to `bslib::bs_theme()`.</span>
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme()
)
```

--
<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Alternatively, set a pre-made [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) theme using the `bootswatch` argument (type `bootswatch_themes()` into your console to get a list of theme names):</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>If you're feeling creative, you can fully customize your own theme! Read the [`bslib` vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html) for detailed instructions.</span> 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(
    bg = "#101010", # background color
    fg = "#FDF7F7", # foreground color
    primary = "#ED79F9", # primary accent color
    base_font = font_google("Prompt"),
    code_font = font_google("JetBrains Mono"))
  )
```

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Be sure to check out the *super cool* interactive themeing widget to test custom color/font/etc. combos before committing by running `bs_theme_preview()` in your console.</span>

.center[
```{r, out.width = '60%', out.height = '60%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("media/bs_theme_preview.gif")
```
]

### **Exercise 7:** Add a theme to your app using `{bslib}`

**To Do:**
* Try adding a `bootswatch` theme or customize your own (see [slide #84](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#123))

**Some tips to get you started:**
* Remember: typing `bootswatch_themes()` into your console will return valid pre-built theme names, or play around with the `bs_theme_preview()` widget for customizing themes!

### Simplify themeing plots with `{thematic}`

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>Call `thematic_shiny()` from the [`{thematic}` package](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/index.html) before launching your app to generate plotOutputs that reflect your application's `bs_theme()`. For example (taken from [Carson Seivert's talk](https://talks.cpsievert.me/20201112/#1) at NHS-R Conference 2020):</span>

<span style = 'font-size:80%;'>**Without calling `thematic_shiny()`:**</span>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
fluidPage(
  theme = bs_theme(bg = "#002B36", fg = "#EEE8D5", primary = "#2AA198", 
                   base_fonts = font_google(("Pacifico")),
  tabsetPanel(type = "pills", 
              tabPanel("ggplot", plotOutput("ggplot")), 
              tabPanel("lattice", plotOutput("lattice")),

### <span style = 'font-size:90%;'>**Exercise 8:** Add an image(s) to your app</span>

<span style = 'font-size:70%;'>You and include static images in your Shiny app using the `img()` function, or even create a reactive `imageOutput` that allows using to select which image they want to display. For example:<span>

### `{reactlog}` can help you debug your shiny app

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>You'll likely find yourself in this situation during your shiny development journey:</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>**1.** you add a new reactive feature to your app, BUT</span>  
<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>**2.** your reactive input doesn't update, AND</span>  
<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>**3.** there's no error in the console to help you troubleshoot</span>  

.footnote[
Reactivity can be *confusing*. I recommend watching Barret Schloerke's talk, linked above, and reading through the [Shiny Reactlog vignette ](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/articles/reactlog.html).
]

--

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>Debugging reactive code is particularly challenging because it involves lots of different components (R values, dependencies) which update over time.</span>

### Using `reactlog`

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>`reactlog` should already be installed as a dependency of `shiny` (but be sure to import the package at the top of your script using `library(reactlog)`). When enabled, it provides an interactive browser-based tool to visualize reactive dependencies and executions in your app.</span>

**Steps:** 

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>**1.** Call `reactlog_enable()` in your console</span>  
<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>**2.** Run your app and interact with it</span>  
<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>**3.** Use the keyboard shortcut `cmd`/`ctrl` + `F3` to launch reactlog</span>  
<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>**4.** Use your `<-` and `->` arrow keys (or <img src="media/previous.png" alt="A gray, left-facing play button" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/> and <img src="media/forward.png" alt="A gray, right-facing play button" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/>) to move forward and backward through your app's reactive life cycle.</span>

### Using `reactlog` -- two examples

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>Let's explore `reactlog` using a small app, though it becomes increasingly more useful as you need to debug larger, more complex apps.</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>I've created two apps, one that's working the way I expect and another that is not. You can fork and clone both apps below if you'd like to run the code yourself.</span> 

* <span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>A functioning app: https://github.com/samanthacsik/reactlog-practice-working</span>
* <span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>A borked app: https://github.com/samanthacsik/reactlog-practice-broken</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>When functioning correctly, both image and text outputs should update based on a `radioButton` user input.<span>

### Using `reactlog` -- [a correctly functioning app](https://github.com/samanthacsik/reactlog-practice-working)

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>To visualize the reactive life cycle of this app, I'll first call `reactlog_enable()` in my console, then run my app. By default, **All penguins** is selected.

--

<span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>I can launch reactlog by using the `cmd`/`ctrl` + `F3` keyboard shortcut and use the <img src="media/forward.png" alt="A gray, right-facing play button" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/> button to move forward through each step:</span>

### Using `reactlog` -- [a correctly functioning app](https://github.com/samanthacsik/reactlog-practice-working)

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>There's a lot to take in here, so let's take it one step at a time:</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>**1.** The `radioButton` input defaults to show the **All penguins** image and associated text. When we launch reactlog, our input <img src="media/input.png" alt="" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/>, reactive expression <img src="media/expression.png" alt="" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/>, and outputs <img src="media/output.png" alt="" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 3px; width:15px;height:15px;"/> are **Ready**, meaning the calculated values are available (defaults in this case) and reactive elements have finished executing (i.e. the image and text is displayed). This **Ready** state is indicated by the green icons.</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>**2.** I (the user) then updated the input by choosing **Sassy chinstrap**, invalidating (i.e. resetting) the input and thereby invalidating any dependencies -- in this case both the image and text outputs. This **Invalidating** state is indicated by the gray icons.</span> 

--

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>**3.** Once all dependencies are invalidated, the reactive elements can begin **Calculating** (i.e. executing) based on the new input (**Sassy chinstrap**). Elements are colored yellow when they are being calculated, then green when calculations are complete and the reactive element has been updated. In this example, first the image and then the text are calculated and updated.</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>**4.** These same steps are repeated when I select the **Staring gentoo**, then **Adorable adelie** `radioButtons`</span>

### Using `reactlog` -- [a borked app](https://github.com/samanthacsik/reactlog-practice-broken)
 <span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>Let's try out reactlog on an intentionally borked app. Here, our images change when the `radioButton` user inputs are updated, but our text doesn't appear.</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>As in our functioning app, the **All penguins** image is selected by default. For demonstration purposes, I'll select each option moving down the list (**Sassy chinstrap**, **Staring gentoo**, **Adorable adelie**) before launching reactlog.</span>

### Using `reactlog` -- [a borked app](https://github.com/samanthacsik/reactlog-practice-broken)

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>Similar to our functioning app, the default input, **All penguins**, and image output are **Ready** (green). However, in this example our text output is *not a dependency* of our application's input -- there's no linkage and the text output is **Invalidated** (gray).</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>As we click down the list of `radioButtons`, the image output is invalidated, then updated accordingly but the text output remains disconnected from our input.</span>

### Using `reactlog` -- [a borked app](https://github.com/samanthacsik/reactlog-practice-broken)

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>This suggests that we ensure that our UI and server are actually able to communicate about our desired text output. After careful inspection of our `textOutput()` and `renderText()` code, we find that a spelling error is to blame:</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>Our `outputId` in the **UI** is set to `penguin_text`:</span>
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # ~ previous code excluded for brevity ~
  
  # text output ----
  textOutput(outputId = `"penguin_text"`)
  
)
```

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>But we call `penguins_text` when rendering our output in the **server**:</span>
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output){
  
  # ~ previous code excluded for brevity ~
  
  # render penguin text ----
  output$`penguins_text` <- renderText({
    
    # ~ code excluded for brevity ~
    
  })
}
```

<span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>By updating our `outputId` to match in both the UI and the server, we fix our app.</span>

### **Exercise 9:** Add your own reactive output to your app

**To Do:**

* <span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>Add a reactive output -- whatever type of you want -- to your application using the **Palmer weather** data set.</span>

**Some tips to get you started:**

* <span style = 'font-size: 70%;'>Review [slide #40](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#71) if you need a reminder of the steps we took to add reactive outputs to our app.</span>

  + <span style = 'font-size: 60%;'>a plot of monthly averages (to compliment our `DT` table from **Exercise 6**), where the user can select which month(s) to display</span>
  + <span style = 'font-size: 60%;'>a plot of multiple attributes (e.g. SST, rainfall, and snow depth) through time, where users can select both the date range *and* which attribute(s) to display</span>

## `r fontawesome::fa("tachometer-alt", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Other application frameworks

Shiny alone provides pretty much everything you need to produce high-quality web applications. *But* there are additional packages and development frameworks that you might explore to help you take your app to the next level.

### Take your shiny app to the next level 

* <span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>[`{shinydashboard}`](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) makes it easy to use shiny to produce visually-appealing dashboards. Pair it with [`{shinydashboardPlus}`](https://rinterface.github.io/shinydashboardPlus/index.html) to enrich your `shinydashboard` with additional functions. If you're looking for inspiration, check out this *awesome* [shiny dashboard exploring kelp forest monitoring data](https://github.com/cullen-molitor/KFM_Shiny_App) from the Channel Islands National Park Service, built by our very own [Cullen Molitor](https://cullen-molitor.github.io/) (MEDS 2022)!</span>

*  <span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>[`{golem}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) is an opinionated framework for building production-grade shiny applications and is a part of a growing ecosystem of packages called the [`{golemverse}`](https://golemverse.org/). There are *lots* of accompanying learning materials, including the book, [Engineering Production Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/), by Colin Fay, Sébastien Rochette, Vincent Guyader, and Cervan Girard.</span>
