**Duration:** ~1/2 day

Ever take a look at that beautiful data visualization you've worked so hard on and think, *"how awesome would it be if my audience could **interact** with my data??"* If so, building a shiny app might just be what you're looking for. `{shiny}` allows you to build interactive web pages and dashboards from R. In this workshop, we'll learn how to transform your data into reactive outputs that you can share via a web browser. Together, we'll be build a shiny app that looks something like [this](https://github.com/samanthacsik/practice-shiny).
